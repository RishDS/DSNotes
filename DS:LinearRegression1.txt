Introduction

In data science applications, it is very common to be interested in the relationship between two or more variables. Linear regression is commonly used to quantify the relationship between two or more variables. It is also used to adjust for confounding. Linear regression is a powerful technique for removing confounders, and it is essential to understand when it is appropriate to use. 

In future chapters we examine a case study relating to the data-driven approach used to construct baseball teams described in the book (and movie) Moneyball.
> how to implement linear regression: We will try to determine which measured outcomes best predict baseball runs and to do this we'll use linear regression. 
> adjust for confounding in practice using R: We will also examine confounding, where extraneous variables affect the relationship between two or more other variables, leading to spurious associations. 

Learning goals:

> How linear regression was originally developed by Galton
> What confounding is and how to detect it
> How to examine the relationships between variables by implementing linear regression in R

Overview: There are three major sections in this course:

Introduction to Linear Regression

> basics of linear regression 
> example: data-driven approach used to construct baseball teams
> correlation
> correlation coefficient
> stratification
> variance

Linear Models

> least squares estimates
> multivariate regression
> several useful features of R, such as - tibbles, lm, do, and broom

Confounding

> confounding
> reasons that correlation is not the same as causation, such as spurious correlation, outliers, reversing cause and effect, and confounders
> Simpson's Paradox
